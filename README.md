## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer who works on training, implementing, and hypertuning models!

I graduated with from California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) with a BS in Computer Science with a Concentration in AI and Machine Learning.

I love solving real, complex problems with talented and passion driven teams hoping to push humanity ever so slightly. 

I love photography, climbing, playing music, and playing card games such as Magic the Gathering, One Piece and RiftBound!

My passion for technology began a long time ago when I couldn't afford any games or any in-game currencies in middle school. Feeling motivated by pay to win games, I rooted my Android phone, and began modifying in-game values via different game softwares. Ever since I have seen technology as an opportunity as suppoed to unknown dark magic of ones and zeroes. 

Since then, I have grown more than I could have ever imagined!
Shortly after graduating during the Covid-19 Pandemic I decided a career in Computer Science was one I wanted to purse, and when the concentration for AI and Machine Learning was announced I knew that I would have the ability to change the world. 

So here we are!
