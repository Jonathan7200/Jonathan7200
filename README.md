## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer who works on training, implementing, and hypertuning models!

I graduated with from California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) with a BS in Computer Science with a Concentration in AI and Machine Learning.

I love solving real, complex problems with talented and passion driven teams hoping to push humanity ever so slightly. 

Some hobbies of mine include photography, climbing, playing music, and playing card games such as Magic the Gathering, One Piece and RiftBound!

My passion for technology began a long time ago when I couldn't afford any games or any in-game currencies in middle school. Feeling motivated by pay to win games, I rooted my Android phone, and began modifying in-game values via different game softwares. Ever since I have seen technology as an opportunity to help those who need it most, rather than a black box of 1s and 0s.

Since then, I have grown more than I could have ever imagined!

Shortly after graduating from high school during the Covid-19 Pandemic, I decided that a career in Computer Science was one I wanted to purse. During this time was also when the concentration for AI and Machine Learning was announced. With this I knew that I would have the ability to change the world for the better.

So here we are!

My name is Jonathan Flores, and I want to change the world, build community and collaborate with those who feel the same.
